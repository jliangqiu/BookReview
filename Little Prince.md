## Book Review: Little Prince

This book is widely acclaimed, but I don't really see why... Certainly, the language is pure, innocent, and beautiful, full of imagination, but I am probably too old for these dreamy scenes. I understand that the author tries to satirize several ridiculous characteristics found on adults, but the story of the little prince is not so impressive. Although I also felt shades of sorrow at the end, when the little prince was bitten by the yellow snake and went back to his planet, but it did not last. Alas, forever gone my childlike innocence...
