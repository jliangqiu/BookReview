## Persuation -- A Social Psychology Reading Digest

Persuasion is an important issue in social lives. From business to social gathering to family life, persuasion plays an important role when we are trying to have other people agree and sometime follow what we have to say.  

According to Myers’ social psychology book, there are several key factors in persuasion:

  1. Who is trying to do the persuasion? (The communicator)
  2. What is being discussed? (The message)
  3. How is the message conveyed? (The channel)
  4. To persuade whom? (The audience)

In order for an effort of persuasion to take place, there are two possible paths:

  1. The central path: focus on the argument, and make the message convincing.
  2. The peripheral path: focus on the cues that triggers automatic acceptance.

The central path is stronger in the sense that it lasts longer, and is less vulnerable to later attack from the opposite argument. The peripheral path, on the other hand, is short-lived, and might be more vulnerable. The central path is used more for the purpose of the arguing important issues, and to compel actions, while the peripheral path triggers temporal behaviors, and is suitable for less intensive occasions such as persuading people to buy soft drinks or vote for a less important position.

For persuasion to fully take effect, one needs to overcome multiple hurdles:

  1. The communicator needs the audience to _pay close attention_.
  2. The message needs to be _understandable_.
  3. The message needs to be _remembered_.
  4. It needs to _compel_ actions.

As one can see, this is not an easy task at all. To accomplish it, the argument needs to be in plain and easy-to-understand language. Humor, analogy, rhetorics, and smart proverbs will definitely help the audience to understand and remember the message better. Finally, the last step — compel actions — is the most important, yet most difficult hurdle to surmount.


### Who Says? Communicator

- __Credibility:__ Credibility usually does not endure the lapse of time. People tend to remember the message while forgetting the source, and the reason to discount it when hearing it from a less credible source.
- __Perceived expertise__: 1) Beginning by saying things the audience agrees with make the speaker seem smart. 2) It also helps to be seen as _knowledgable_ on the topic. 3) Finally, speaking confidently. No "uh", "you know", etc.
- __Perceived trustworthiness:__ 1) Look at the subjects in the eyes. 2) Trustworthiness is higher if the qudience believes the communicator is _not_ trying to persuade them. 3) More trustworthy if argue against self-interest. 4) Trustworthiness increases when people talk fast.
- __Attractiveness and Liking:__ 1) Our liking of a communicator may open us up to the his/her arguments. 2) Similarity also makes for attractiveness.
- __Similarity vs. Credibility__: For the choices of _subjective preferences_, such as personal value, taste, or way of life, _similar_ communicators have the most influence. For the _objective reality_, such as judgement of fact, credibility is more important than similarity.

__[Example]__ An experiment: A "digital" person in virtual reality mimicking the subject's actions, such as tilting head, lokking up, etc. Human subjects like the mimicking person more than non-mimicking person.


### What is said? The Message Content

- __Reason vs. Emotion:__
    * Well-educated or analytical people are more responsive to rational appeals. Uninterested audiences are more affected by their liking of the communicator. 
    * Messages become more persuasive through association with good feelings.
    * Messages can also be effective by evoking negative emotions -- for example, printing scary pictures on a cigarette pack can reduce people's consumption. Often, the more frightened and vulnerable people feel, the more they respond. Playing on fear works best if a message scares people, but provide a solution which they are capable of implementing.
    * __[Example]__ Nazi propaganda aroused fear with unsubstantiated anecdotes about Jews, and instructed people to avoid their business.
- __Discrepancy:__
    * Question: if one would like to persuade someone to change position, is it best to take baby steps or to argue for the other extreme.
    * Answer: _Credible_ source, such as authorities, would elicit the most opinion change when advocating a _greatly discrepant_ position. Otherwise, take a mildly different position.
- __One Sided vs. Two Sided Appeals:__
    * Two sided arguments are more effective towards those who originally oppose the message.
    * One sided arguments work well for strengthening people's believe when they are originally for the message.
    * Best strategy: _If your audience will be exposed to opposing views, offer a two-sided appeal._
- __Primacy vs. Recency:__
    * Question: in a debate, whether to go first?
    * Answer: 1) When two persuasive messages are back-to-back and audience responds sometime later, the first wins (_Primacy_ effect), 2) while when two messages are separated for a while, and audience responds soon after the second, the second winds (_Recency_ effect).
    * When offered two options, such as at dinner or a mall, the first introduced is more likely to win.


### How is it Said: Channel of Communication

- __Types of Channels:__ Face-to-face appeal, a written document, media advertisement, etc.
- __Passively Received Appeals:__ Persuasion decreases as the significance and familiarity of the issue increase. For example, for unfamiliar issues such as brand of aspirin, media domination can be powerful. For familiar and important issues, such as attitudes about a lengthy war, persuasion is hard.
- __Personal vs. Media Influence:__ Major influence is not media but our contact with people, i.e., word-of-mouth influence. Media works in a two-step flow of communication: from media to opinion leaders to the rank and file.
