## Reading Digiest: Art of Converation

This is the book by Cai Kangyong about how to make a conversation interesting, and how to make oneself popular. It is a very interesting book. Kangyong is obviously a humorous guy, judged from the book. Although I have not watched any of his shows, he cannot become so famous without being able to harness conversations, even with super stars, important goverment officials, and successful business people.

In this book, he does not talk too much about how to make oneself popular, but instead, he focuses on different scenarios and what to do and say under different circumstances. I list the ones that are interesting and useful here.

### Pay attention

When dining together on a date, it is important to have communication, not to just keep staring at the menu. For example, joking about old mistakes, paying attention to the date's reactions to your suggestions of food, etc. is way more important than ordering.

### Change of subject

If chatting on something that sounds boring to you, try shifting to a different but more interesting topic from it. Don't say things that others cannot continue with.

### Don't get stuck in one topic

Getting stuck with a topic is quite normal. Simply change a subject and don't keep getting stuck... If you get the other to laugh happily for three times in two hours, they are extremely unlikely to remember the boring topics you bring up.

### Asking questions

When asking questions, ask more specific questions. For example, asking "what kind of countries do you like to visit" is not as good as "have you been scamed when you travel?" It makes it easy for others to answer, and can manufature a feeling of closeness and mutual understanding.

### Connect things that are hard to remember to something concrete

I paraphrased this point. Basically, when talking about something about oneself that is not easy to remember, like a name or year of birth, it will be much easier for others to remember by making it more concrete. I can introduce myself as "Maokai, like a mouse flying a kite" in the future. :)

### Reciprocity

When asking for help, do not only mention that you need the help. Also mention why it is good for the others. It is easier and less annoying. Of course, if you can repay the favor while he/she is helping out it is even better. For example, to ask someone to introduce business, one can say "You haven't get in touch with xxx for a while, right? Maybe you wanna pay a visit together?" It is easier for others to accept this way because you mentioned why it is beneficial for them as well.
