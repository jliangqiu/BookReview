## Book Review: 36 Rules for Startups

I have been reading the book "36 Rules for Startups" by _Taoran Sun_, who founded several successful business and is famous in the circle of entrepreneurs. In this book, he introduce several fundamental rules for startups. I do not agree with all of them, and some of the rules seem to contradict each other, but in general, it provides great guidances for a founder-to-be like me. Here are the digests from the book, tailored to my current situation.

#### 1. Perseverance and Power of Mind

The most important trait of successful entrepreneurs is perseverance. Many failed on the way to success, and many failed just several steps away from success. There will be hard time on the journey. When the time comes, do not look too far from that moment, as the future might be dull and situations could be daunting. Focus on lasting for one more week, or even one more day. The longer one can last, the more likely some miracles could happen and lucks could hit.

To keep on going even during rough patches, it requires a great power of mind. One needs to be optimistic and cheerful even just one day from running out of money. This will be hard, but it is necessary. It is natural to worry, but rein it in and do not show it. It could be contagious for the team.

#### 2. Do not Think Too Much of Myself

This is especially important to me. Do not take myself too seriously. Do whatever needed (within the boundary of law of course) even if it means to make a fool of myself, or talk to or even beg people I don't like or even despise. As long as it helps the business, I should man up and do it. It won't kill me.

#### 3. Take Risks

Fortune favors the bold. Startups need to take risks, and should break the routines if it means to make things run more efficiently. People will defy by saying they always do it this way. If there is no good reason, it means the tradition could be broken. Take risks, break routines. We might make mistakes, but fail quickly, and adjust quickly.

#### 4. Shareholders

According to the book, one needs to limit the number of shareholders, because the company has to satisfy their demands for information and answer for their needs. Sometimes they'll even have strong opinion about the direction of the company, which might be a conflict to the manager's vision.

I am skeptical about this. It might be correct in China, especially dealing with state-owned companies, but in US, it seems to be a standard practice to distribute shares. Maybe it's stock options instead of stocks -- need to figure this out on the way.

#### 5. Business and Management

Make money early to validate the business mode. Do not always think that we can make money once we have many users. That's probably suitable for certain hyper-growth companies, but is not a general rules.

A good company needs a company culture from the beginning. It can make the whole team to be cohesive and row in the same direction. From the beginning, the managers need to build a good management team that can lead and take care of business in different areas.

#### 6. Raise Capital

Modern startups need to raise capitals in order to compete. Before raising the money, try the best to verify the idea and business mode. Be clear about what the money is for.

For the development of the company, one should be willing to take lower evaluation if necessary. Raise the capital when you _don't_ need it. When negotiating terms, yield on the terms with smaller probability or the ones in the failure cases (such as bankruptcy). In exchange, stand strong on the terms that has big impacts on daily decision makings. Investors will always say it's business routine, and others also do it, but anything can be negotiated.

#### 7. A procedure of prototyping:

1. Confirm the goal.
2. Derive the strategy.
3. Carefully prototype (business mode and/or product) and test in a small community.
4. Fast and determined expansion with the successful prototype.
