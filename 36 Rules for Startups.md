## Book Review: 36 Rules for Startups

I have been reading the book "36 Rules for Startups" by Taoran Sun, who founded a series of successful business and is famous in the circle of entrepreneurs. In this book, he introduce several fundamental rules for startups. I do not agree with all of them, and some of the rules seem to contradict each other, but in general, it provides great guidances for an founder-to-be like me. Here are several important digests from the book, tailored to my current situation.

#### 1. Perseverance and Power of Mind

The most important trait of successful entrepreneurs is perseverance. Many failed on the way to success, and many failed just several steps away from success. There will be hard time on the journey. When the time comes, do not look too far from that moment, as the future might be dull and situations could be daunting. Focus on lasting for one more week, or even one more day. The longer one can last, the more likely some miracle and luck could hit.

To keep on going even during rough patch, it requires a great power of mind. I need to be optimistic and cheerful even if we are one day from running out of money. This will be hard, but it is necessary. Do not worry too much. Even if I do, rein it in and do not show it. It could be contagious for the team.

#### 2. Do not Think Too Much of Myself

This is especially important to me. Do not take myself too seriously. Do wantever needed (within the boundary of law of course) even if it means to make a fool of myself, or talk or even beg for people I don't like or even despise. As long as it helps the business, I should man up and do it. It won't kill me.

#### 3. Take Risks

Fortune favors the bold. Startups need to take risks, and should break the routines if it means to make things run more efficiently. People will defy by saying they always do it this way. If there is no good reason, it means the tradition could be broken. Take risks, break routines. We might make mistakes, but fail quickly, and adjust quickly.
