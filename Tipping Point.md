## Book Review: Tipping Point

This is a book talks about how something becomes a fashion and come to be known and adopted by a large amount of people.

It is a useful book for business and marketing. It emphasizes several factors about how an idea, a product, or even a disease becomes explosively popular. The ideas are interesting, and the examples and stories are intriguing. However, although the book tries to convince the reader that the factors described in the book are the most essential reasons something becomes a fashion, one needs to keep an open mind about other possible factors as well. These different factors might either become important or useless based on different applications and scenarios.


### Important _People_

Ideas or products become popular often thanks to a very small group of people. This chapter illustrate the characteristics of these people and explains the roles they play in the process.

* __Connectors__

    These are the people who have wide connections and spend time maintaining them. Some people either have the natural ability to keep in touch with a large number of people and update with them constantly, or they pay attention cultivating such connections. In technical terms, these people have a large degree of connections, and consequently have a larger influence. A key in marketing is to identify these people and leverage their influences.

* __Experts__

    These are the people who know more about a certain subject than normal people. The exitence of such people can deter merchants from cheating customers because although the general public are unaware of such deception, the experts are and can exert their influence to informs people in their network. A connector might ask all 1000 friends not to buy something, and 200 may listen to them, while an expert might only have a network of 300 people, yet also 200 people will listen to them because their friends know his expert status and trust him/her.

    A combination of experts and connectors is powerful because a connector might get information from an expert and use his/her own network for information dissemination.

* __Sales__

    These are the people who can persuade other people to buy a product or use a service. They can even exert their ability to convince strangers. These people are usually energetic, charming, and confident. They complement the connectors and experts to further advance the boundary of information dissemination.


### Make it Last

The author discusses how to make an influence work. He focuses on TV education: how to develop a program can attract kids and educate them at the same time. This section is less relevant to what I am after now, so I will summarize it briefly.

The main case study is about the production of _Sesame Street_, a popular and long-lasting kid's education TV program in the US. The producers do many researches trying to keep children's attentions for as long as possible, and educate them at the same time. Some key conclusions are:

* Children are easily distracted when the scenes are something too complicated for them to understand.
* Children are not easily attracted by smart puns.
* Children do not mind repeating as much as adults do.
* Arranging the contents from easy to hard with repeating is a better way for children to learn.
* Children often have hard time recognizing a same thing with two names. They associate a name with one thing. If it was given a different name, the original name would be substituted.

    My comments: This is very common in learning. For example, to learn an English word, it is the best to give it one meaning first without mentioning other very different meanings. Those meanings can be learned later.

My thoughts: This section is less related to business, and in my opinion less persuasive than the previous chapter.


### Environment Impact

In this part, the author argues that a seeminly trivial change of environment can cause a dramatic change of behaviors. The author list the following several examples:

* The _Broken Window Theory_: If an window in a block is broken and not fixed for a while, more and more windows will also be broken. The most famous illustration of this theory is that the police department in NYC significantly reduce the crime rate by catching people who do not buy tickets in the subway. They also clean up the subway environment and trains. These "small" movements lead to the plunge of crime rate in NYC.

* The Stanford prison experiment: The author uses this experiment to demonstrate the importance of environment. He argues that people often over-emphasize people's intrinsic virture and under-estimate the impact of their surroundinglys.

* An experiment: People's willingness to help injured people on the road does not depend on what their religious believes are, or what information they receive right before it. It depends on a travial factor: whether they are in a hurry.

* 150 rule: People in an organization can still get to know each other (or know who to seek help from) when the group size is below 150. The efficiency of working together is also higher. When it is above 150, people become less collegial and less efficient as a team.

My thoughts: The most valuable lesson from this chapter is that one should not under-estimate the impact of environment. One should always try to find the most important exogenous factor to start a viral fashion.


### Final Thoughts

The first chapter is not only brilliant but very convincing. In order to make products or services popular, one needs the help of the three types of people. It is not an easy task to find a proper channel to reach to these people, but when we can reach them, we need to make sure that most of them like our product. Listen to them and provide the highest quality of service is critical.

The second and third chapters are less attractive, at least for business purpose. In general it is a good book and worth reading.
